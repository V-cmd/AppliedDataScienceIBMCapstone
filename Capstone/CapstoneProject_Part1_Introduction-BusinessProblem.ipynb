    "Madrid, being Spain's capital, is an extremely packed location. For better or worse, opening a restaurant can be an extremely complicated task, especially when finsing a location. I will use all of the skills learned in IBM's Coursera Data Science course, including Data Visualization, Analysis, Advanced Machine learning techniques, among others.\n",

    "I'm a Spaniard living in China married to a Colombian, who is considering a restaurnat in Spain. Taking this into account, I was faced with two choices, find the best location for a Chinese restauran in Madrid, or a Colombian one. Considering Madrid has many Chinese restuarnats, I decided to investigate the Latino side of food"

Using this, we do not only find the best location for a restaurant, but in general any type of recreational venue, for population density is crutial when opening a new venue.\n",
