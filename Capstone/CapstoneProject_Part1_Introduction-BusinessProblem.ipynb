    "## Background:\n",
    "Cataluña is one of the most densly hotel-packed regions in the world. With a total of 3,040 hotels and over 300,000 beds. Cataloña also holds one of the leading regions in this sector, Barcelona. (https://www.albawaba.com/business/dubai-makes-it-worlds-top-10-cities-most-hotel-rooms-955290). However, for the average tourist, the amount of stars should not define whether a hotel is suitable or not, which is why I created this code. I will analize the dentify of high standard hotels in Cataluña and pair the information with venues thatt surround those regions. By doing this, I am hoping to find the ultimate tourist region in Cataluña.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "With an outstanding 10,991 million euros \"in terms of international tourist spending figues\", Cataluña accounts \"for 22.4% of tourist spending in Spain between January and July\", 2017. (https://barcelonacatalonia.eu/archivos/5761) Consideing this, it is important to find the most comfortable, packed and interesting region possible.\n",
